    "In particular we will use the 'explore' endpoint via a Regular API call containing the query \"Yoga Studio\", being the predominant Foursquare database category for yoga-related venues. The main data we are interested in retrieving are Venue Name, Latitude and Longitude. We will then extract, pre-process and load the data into a framework (dataframe) ready for modeling and evaluation."
